      <h2>
        1. What are migrations in Rails and why are they important? (Short
        Notes)
      </h2>

      <h3>‚úÖ Definition:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Migrations are Ruby classes used to modify the database schema.</li>
        <li>They act like version control for your database.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üåü Key Benefits:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Collaboration:</strong> Easy schema sharing across teams.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensures all environments are in sync.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reversible:</strong> Supports safe rollbacks.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Version Tracking:</strong> Keeps a complete history of schema
          changes via migration files.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üéÅ Why Important:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keeps schema consistent across environments (dev/test/prod).</li>
        <li>Avoids manual SQL; changes are trackable in code.</li>
        <li>Supports rollback and forward migration of schema.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>‚öôÔ∏è How They Work:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Stored in <code>db/migrate</code> with timestamped filenames.</li>
        <li>Run using <code>rails db:migrate</code>.</li>
        <li>Rollback using <code>rails db:rollback</code>.</li>
        <li>Tracks state using <code>schema_migrations</code> table.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üîÄ Extras:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Schema is also reflected in <code>schema.rb</code> or
          <code>structure.sql</code>.
        </li>
        <li>Reversible operations supported via <code>change</code> method.</li>
        <li>Can include data changes, not just structure.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Advanced Rails Migration Questions and Answers</h2>

      <h3>1. How does Rails know which migrations have been run already?</h3>
      <p>
        Rails uses a special table called <code>schema_migrations</code> which
        stores the timestamps of the migrations that have been executed. When
        you run <code>rails db:migrate</code>, Rails checks this table to see
        which migrations are pending.
      </p>

      <h3>
        2. What's the difference between <code>change</code>, <code>up</code>,
        and <code>down</code> in migrations?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>change</code> is used when Rails can infer how to reverse the
        migration. <code>up</code> is for applying changes, and
        <code>down</code> is for reversing them manually. Use
        <code>up/down</code> when changes are not reversible automatically.
      </p>

      <h3>
        3. What happens if a migration fails halfway? How do you ensure
        atomicity?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Rails wraps each migration in a transaction (if supported by the DB). If
        it fails, the entire migration is rolled back. For large or unsupported
        operations, consider manual steps or idempotent scripts.
      </p>

      <h3>
        4. Difference between <code>schema.rb</code> and
        <code>structure.sql</code>?
      </h3>
      <p>
        <code>schema.rb</code> is Ruby-based and DB-agnostic.
        <code>structure.sql</code> captures full SQL including DB-specific
        features. Use <code>structure.sql</code> for advanced DB features like
        triggers, views, or custom functions.
      </p>

      <h3>5. How do you write a reversible migration when modifying data?</h3>
      <p>
        Use the <code>reversible</code> method inside <code>change</code> to
        specify both up and down actions explicitly.
      </p>

      <h3>
        6. Limitations of migrations in production and how to handle them?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Large table changes (e.g., adding columns with default, renaming) can
        lock tables. Use background data migration, add columns without
        defaults, or use batching techniques.
      </p>

      <h3>
        7. Team member references old column after it's renamed. What to do?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Communicate clearly, revert or adjust their migration, and coordinate
        schema changes via code reviews and feature branches.
      </p>

      <h3>8. Bad migration deployed to production. How to recover?</h3>
      <p>
        Use <code>rails db:rollback</code> if safe. Otherwise, create a new
        corrective migration. Avoid editing past migrations in production
        environments.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Backfilling millions of rows efficiently?</h3>
      <p>
        Use background jobs, batching (e.g., in slices of 1000 records), and
        avoid locking the table by deferring default values.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Drop a column used by unknown code?</h3>
      <p>
        Search the codebase, deprecate with warnings, monitor usage logs, then
        safely remove after a grace period.
      </p>

      <h3>11. Can migrations be run concurrently?</h3>
      <p>
        No, Rails assumes linear, non-concurrent migration execution. Running
        multiple at the same time can lead to race conditions or schema
        mismatch.
      </p>

      <h3>12. Difference between running migrations in dev vs production?</h3>
      <p>
        In development, migrations are instant and low risk. In production,
        large changes may require downtime planning, background processing, or
        safer operations like adding indexes concurrently.
      </p>

      <h3>13. Safe deployment of a huge migration in production?</h3>
      <p>
        Break it into smaller steps, use <code>add_column</code> without
        default, backfill in background jobs, then add constraints later.
      </p>

      <h3>14. Re-adding an index with different options?</h3>
      <p>
        Use <code>remove_index</code> followed by <code>add_index</code> with
        new options. Use <code>algorithm: :concurrently</code> if supported by
        the DB to avoid locking.
      </p>

      <h3>15. Version control of migrations in monorepos?</h3>
      <p>
        Namespace migrations by engine, ensure each engine has its own migration
        path, and resolve conflicts with careful versioning and coordination.
      </p>

      <h3>16. Migration is not reversible. What now?</h3>
      <p>
        Add a custom <code>down</code> method or use
        <code>reversible do |dir|</code> block to define both directions
        explicitly.
      </p>

      <h3>17. Safely add foreign keys with existing data?</h3>
      <p>
        Ensure data integrity first (clean up orphaned records), then add the
        constraint. Consider disabling validations temporarily if necessary.
      </p>

      <h3>18. Organizing and naming migrations in large apps?</h3>
      <p>
        Use descriptive names (e.g., <code>add_status_to_orders</code>), group
        related changes, and avoid overlapping schema edits in parallel
        branches.
      </p>

      <h3>19. CI/CD migration timeout. What to do?</h3>
      <p>
        Profile the migration locally, optimize it (e.g., add columns without
        defaults), or move long tasks to a background job.
      </p>

      <h3>20. Renaming a table used by external services?</h3>
      <p>
        Coordinate with stakeholders, create a view or alias for backward
        compatibility, or schedule downtime with proper notification.

      <h2>Validations and Callbacks in Rails</h2>

      <h3>Validations:</h3>
      <p>
        Validations are rules you set in your Rails model to make sure that the
        data saved to the database is correct and complete. For example, you can
        validate that a user‚Äôs email is present and unique, or that a password
        is at least 6 characters long. If the data doesn‚Äôt pass these checks,
        Rails won‚Äôt save it.
      </p>

      <h3>Callbacks:</h3>
      <p>
        Callbacks are special methods that run automatically at certain points
        in the life of an object, like before it is saved, after it is created,
        or before it is deleted. You use callbacks to perform actions like
        sending a welcome email after a user signs up, or cleaning up related
        data before deleting a record.
